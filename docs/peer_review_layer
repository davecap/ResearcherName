How can I implement a peer review system on top of the valid scientist author database?
- use the OpenID/OAuth/Salmon?

What is the simplest peer review system?

- Author A writes publication PA
- Author B writes publication PB in response to PA (this is a review)

Publications:
	- Have 1+ authors
	- May be in response to 1+ Publications
	- Have 0+ references
	- Have revisions (each revision is independent)
	- May be public or private

A little more complicated, with Requests For Review (RFRs)

- Author A writes publication PA, revision 1 -> PA1
- Author A sends a Request For Review (RFR) to author B
	- RFR(A,B, PA1) status: sent
- Author B accepts RFR(A,B,PA1) status: accepted
- Author B writes publication PB, revision 1 in response to PA1
	- This completes RFR(A, B, PA1) status: complete
