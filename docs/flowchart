		- if user is still invalid, send them to validation by indirect-affiliation

pre-validation by affiliation algorithm
	- input: email address that has already been validated (email+key sent and received)
	- Find all affiliations by the (verified) email address
	- if affiliations found
		- show all possible publications
		- ask user to add the publications to their list
		- set user to verified
		- show all requests from other people (see: validation by indirect-affiliation)			- for each Request(with any of the user's email addresses) show: Request Response View
				- if R.publication not in user's collection
					- are you an author of this paper? yes/no
				- "Some Person" with email address some.person@school.edu is claiming authorship of this publication
					- accept / deny
					- set other user to verified

validation by indirect-affiliation
	- User must have at least 1 publication
	- Find corresponding authors from each publication and assemble into unique list
	- For each corresponding email address:
		- Create new Request(user, corresponding email address, publication ID)
		- if user(corresponding email address) isn't signed up:
			- Send Invitation to the email address asking them to sign up and reply to the request so that both can become verified
	- User has to wait for the other scientists to sign-up and/or respond to the request
