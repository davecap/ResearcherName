FAQ

What is OnPAR?

OnPAR is the only network built exclusively for scientific researchers.

How does it work?

OnPAR was made from the motivation to bring science online. It is designed to be an online, open platform for scientists in a number of fields. The core of OnPAR is based on open-source technology standards to provide scientists with secure login credentials that can be used on any other site. There is a level of trust when using OnPAR such that any user can be traced directly to either to a peer-reviewed publication or to the corresponding author of a peer-reviewed publication.

A user that requests an OnPAR ID simply needs to sign up using his or her email address (although multiple email addresses may be linked to a single account). If he or she is a corresponding author of a peer-reviewed paper, OnPAR will automatically authorize a new ID for them. If not, the user must select all of their publications and wait for one or more of their colleagues to authorize them based on their current email address.

Who is behind OnPAR?

OnPAR was built and designed by a group of technically-inclined scientists based in North America.
