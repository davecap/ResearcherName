I want to model this in a very modular way so that I can write simple, encapsulated web servers for each system... they essentially operate on their own.

UserSubsystem
	This is where user data is stored for all users of the system. It may store references to the Activity and Publication subsystems.
	- Invitations
	- Requests

PublicationSubsystem
	This is the subsystem used for containing MEDLINE publications. For now we only store MEDLINE data, but in the future we might use other data for validation.
	* THIS IS THE PRIMARY DATA SOURCE FOR VALIDATION *
	
	- MongoDB
	- Baseline importer
	- Autoupdate code (low priority)
	- Pubmed search system
	- Local indexing
	- Unique IDs

ActivitySubsystem
	This is the logging system that allows us to trace user activity. The important thing here is to be able to keep track of who invited who, etc...
	
	TODO: is this necessary?
