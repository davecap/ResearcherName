Invitations can come from the system or from another user. The whole purpose is to get the person to be aware or the service.
Invitation emails should contain informative stuff about the service as well as papers where the target email is a corresponding author.

user gets email with a link to join researcher.name
if they click the link and sign up, their email address is already verified.

/account/email/verify?k=<UserEmail.key>
    TODO: how to other sites do this?
    - verify the key before
