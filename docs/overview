This is a platform for science on the web. The idea being that every user has an activity stream and you can follow any other researcher on the network.
The core of the system is the verified scientist layer. This is an OAuth server full of users who are verified scientists.

The researcher can propose their own <name> which will be used as their OpenID. They can then log in to other services that require validated scientists or link other services to their researcher.name account.

Online profile address: researcher.name/<name>
Users can login with any verified email address under their account.

From here, other systems based on this platform can be created which link up this OpenID account.

	- Formal peer review (???)
		- PLoS backend?
	- Informal peer review (blogs, microblogs)
	- Data storage (PDB, GEO)
		- Anything linked to PMID can be used right away
		- Anything with a valid email address can be associated with the researcher of the same email address
	- Reference management
	- Sharing and collaboration

The core OAuth profile can then be used to build credit on a verified online persona. This becomes your online resume as a scientist.
You can also follow other researchers to stay up to date.
